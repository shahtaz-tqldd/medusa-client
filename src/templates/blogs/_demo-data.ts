    body: "Writing optimized code in React involves several best practices. Start by minimizing the number of renders with `React.memo` and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Leverage `useMemo` to cache expensive calculations. Avoid anonymous functions and inline objects in the `render` method. Lazy load components with `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to split your code into manageable chunks. Lastly, consider using a state management library like Redux or React Context API to handle complex state, improving the performance of your application.",

    body: "Dockerizing your Node.js project can significantly streamline your development workflow. Start by creating a `Dockerfile` at the root of your project. Use a lightweight Node.js base image, copy your application code, and install dependencies. Define the working directory and set environment variables as needed. Ensure your application listens on a port and expose it in the Dockerfile. Finally, build the Docker image with `docker build` and run it using `docker run`. This encapsulates your application in a container, ensuring consistency across different environments.",
