    content: "It all started with a blinking cursor and trembling fingers. That first `console.log('Hello World!')` felt like magic—words appearing on screen from pure thought. Little did I know, this simple line would be the first of millions. I was chasing curiosity back then, not careers. Each error felt like a riddle, each fix a small victory. The mystery of how invisible instructions could shape visible outcomes was intoxicating. Nights blurred into mornings, and slowly, the unfamiliar syntax transformed into a language I could think in. It wasn’t just code—it was a way of commanding possibilities.",

    title: "Projects Over Perfection",
    content: "After countless tutorials and unfinished side projects, something shifted. I stopped chasing 'perfect' code and started building things that solved real problems. A simple to-do app for my overwhelmed days. A portfolio site that was more chaotic experiment than polished product. But each small project taught me more than any textbook. I discovered the beauty of version control, the frustration of deployment bugs, and the pride of watching someone else use something I made. This was the era where I traded perfectionism for progress, learning that done was better than perfect and shipping taught lessons that debugging never could.",

    title: "Finding My Stack",
    content: "The deeper I dove, the clearer my preferences became. Frontend frameworks felt like digital playgrounds, while backend logic became a quiet, reliable companion. React hooked me with its component-driven elegance. Django charmed me with its philosophy of clean, pragmatic design. Docker made me feel like a wizard conjuring up isolated universes on command. This wasn’t about trends; it was about tools that made ideas flow faster. Every technology adopted was a reflection of a problem I was trying to solve. My stack wasn’t chosen overnight—it was earned through trial, error, and the persistent pursuit of 'a better way.'",

    title: "Beyond the Code",
    content: "Somewhere along the journey, I realized it wasn’t just about building apps—it was about building *myself*. Code taught me patience, humility, and how to fail gracefully. Communities online became my classrooms, mentors showed up in unexpected pull requests, and collaborations turned into friendships. Each project, bug, and late-night sprint was less about lines of code and more about stories lived. Now, I see development as a way to shape experiences, solve human problems, and leave small footprints on the web’s endless canvas. And though the cursor still blinks, it no longer intimidates—it invites.",
