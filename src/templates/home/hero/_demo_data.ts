      "From the heart of metallurgy to the world of code — I traded alloys for algorithms. My journey began not with a bootcamp, but a dream: to build a travel startup. With no roadmap, I stumbled into Python and JavaScript, broke things, built again, and discovered a strange joy in debugging my own mess. That was my first hello to code — and I never looked back.",

    title: "Projects Over Perfection",
    content:
      "I didn’t chase perfection — I chased progress. I tore down tutorials, rewired concepts, and rebuilt the UI from the ground up. React became my canvas, and I kept sketching. My startup dream took a pause, not from doubt — but from the clarity that before I lead, I must learn. And so I dove deeper, choosing messy, meaningful projects over pristine theory.",

    title: "Finding My Stack",
    content:
      "Freelance gigs gave way to real teams. I worked remotely, then stepped on-site at Aaykori to feel the pulse of a startup. Six months of full-stack chaos taught me more than any course ever could. At Echologyx, I first danced with A/B testing, then led a solo project in visual testing automation — blending React, OpenCV, and live browser streams into something that felt like magic.",

    title: "Beyond the Code",
    content:
      "Curiosity pulled me backend. I joined the engine room of an AI-powered chatbot, crafting logic with Django and orchestrating flow. From pixels to pipelines, my journey has been part builder, part poet. And somewhere between the lines of code, that travel dream still sleeps — waiting to be awakened by a sharper, wiser version of me.",
